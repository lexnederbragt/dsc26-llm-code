- Instructor for The Carpentries


## Possibilities with LLMs

* Ask for code
* Run that code
* Analyze (data)files

::: {.fragment}
### But

* Not with UiO approved tools
* Subscription
:::

## Tools that can do this

* Cursor
* Claude Code
* Open AI Codex
* Google Gemini CLI
* ...

::: {.fragment}
### This workshop

* Something a bit different

## About this workshop

### Connect an IDE through an API to an LLM to produce and run code
 
* IDE: Integrated Development Environment
* API: Application Programming interface
  * let's you 'talk' to a website/program/service
* LLM: Large Language Model (e.g. chatbot)


## About this workshop

### Connect an IDE through an API to an LLM to produce and run code
 
* IDE: Visual Studio Code from Microsoft
* API: UiO's Azure API to models
* LLM: OpenAI's GPT models

## About this workshop

The goals

* Use an LLM connected through Visual Studio Code to write computer code and execute it
* Know the benefits of efficiently prompting the LLM, and the iterative process to obtain a functioning program
* Discuss ethical and practical considerations when using LLM-based tools in scientific research

## About this workshop

### Programming language

* Instructor will use Python
* Should be OK to use any other language that is installed on your laptop
* More common languagues will probaby work better

## Caveats


::: {.incremental}
* Installation may be problematic for some
* The workshop may run smooth - or not

## Why use this setup?

* Yellow data
* Latest models, often available earlier than through gpt.uio.no

## Ethical considerations

::: {.incremental}

* Where does the code come from?
* Who pays for this?
* Environmental footprint?

:::

## How to get access to UiO's Azure resources

* https://www-int.uio.no/tjenester/it/ki/gpt-uio/bestill-api/api.html
* Setup fee: 800 kr
* Takes a few working days to set up
* Billing starts when usage > 500 NOK (per month? per year?)

## Local models?

* Often not good enough
* Recommend using Ollama and the biggest model optimized for coding
  that your machine can handle
  * ollama.com
  * docs.roocode.com/providers/ollama
* Soon: API access to local models provided by UiO/NTNU
